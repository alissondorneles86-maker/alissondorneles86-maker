# defense.sh

## Functionality
- Executes `detect_cpu.sh` to identify high CPU usage processes.  
- Executes `kill_automatic.sh` to terminate abusive processes automatically.  
- Appends timestamps to `defense.log` for full audit tracking.  

## Result
- All high CPU processes detected and terminated automatically.  
- Logs updated with timestamps and action summaries.  
- Single entry point for automated CPU abuse monitoring and response.  

## Purpose
Learning exercise focusing on:  
- Bash scripting for automation  
- Defensive Linux operations
