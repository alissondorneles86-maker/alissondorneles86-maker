# Linux Fundamentals

Building a strong foundation in Linux with focus on system administration, security concepts and daily practice.
This repository documents my learning process and hands-on exercises.

## Users and Permissions
In Linux, each file has an owner, a group and permissions.
Permissions define who can read, write or execute files.

Key concepts:
- Users and groups
- File ownership
- Permission model (r, w, x)

Commands:
- whoami
- id
- ls -l
- chmod
- chown

## Basic Process Management
Processes are running programs in the system.
Linux provides tools to monitor and control them.

Commands:
- ps
- top
- kill

---

## Logs Overview
Logs store system events, errors and authentication records.
They are essential for troubleshooting and security analysis.

Common locations:
- /var/log
- /var/log/syslog
- /var/log/auth.log
