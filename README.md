# Alisson Dorneles

Focused on Linux systems, defensive automation, and Blue Team operations.

## Profile
I specialize in understanding **how Linux systems behave under normal and abnormal conditions**, and in designing **automated defensive responses** based on real system signals.

My approach prioritizes:
- System visibility
- Log-driven intelligence
- Automation with accountability
- Defensive thinking grounded in real operations

## Core Skills
- Linux system analysis and hardening
- User, permission, and session auditing
- Process monitoring and resource control
- Log analysis and threat correlation
- Bash scripting for defensive automation
- Blue Team operational mindset

## What You’ll Find Here
This repository contains **practical security projects** designed to:

- Monitor system behavior
- Detect abnormal or malicious activity
- React automatically using defensive logic
- Maintain clear audit trails for review and forensics

Everything here was:
- Written by me
- Tested by me
- Understood line by line
- Built to reflect real-world defensive scenarios

## Projects

### Automatic CPU Abuse Defense
Automated detection and termination of processes exceeding defined CPU thresholds.

Focus:
- Process behavior analysis
- Resource abuse mitigation
- Automated response with logging

### Active Intrusion Prevention (Auto-Block)
Log-based intrusion prevention system that detects brute-force authentication attempts and enforces automated firewall blocking.

Focus:
- Authentication log intelligence
- Threshold-based detection
- Defensive firewall automation
- Blue Team response patterns

## Direction
My focus is **not tools**.

It is:
- Understanding system behavior
- Controlling it through automation
- Designing defenses that make sense in production environments

This repository reflects a continuous progression toward **high-level defensive Linux operations and security engineering**.
