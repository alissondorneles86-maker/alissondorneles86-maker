# Linux Permissions

Linux uses permissions to control access to files and directories.

## Permission types
- r (read): view file content
- w (write): modify file content
- x (execute): run a file or access a directory

## Common permission examples
- 600: private files (only owner can read and write)
- 755: executable scripts (owner full access, others can execute)

## Why permissions matter
Permissions protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized execution.
They are a core security mechanism in Linux systems.
